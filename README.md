# ðŸ§ª jupyter-lab

A lightweight, Dockerized **JupyterLab sandbox** for interactive Python data exploration, visualization, and experimentation â€” with batteries included.

Supports out-of-the-box loading of `.parquet`, `.csv`, and other datasets, plus plotting and fast querying via `pandas`, `duckdb`, and `plotly`.

## ðŸ§± Project Structure

```
jupyter-lab/
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile             # Python + Jupyter + data libraries
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml     # Mounts host folders and runs JupyterLab
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                  # Place your input data here (.parquet, .csv, etc.)
â””â”€â”€ src/                   # Your notebooks and Python scripts live here
```

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Add your files

- Drop `.parquet`, `.csv`, and resources into the `data/` folder.
- Save notebooks, scripts, and other files in `src/`.

### 2. Build and run

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

JupyterLab will start on port **8888** and print a login URL with a token.

### 3. Open in browser

Visit the link shown in the terminal (`http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=...`).

You'll see `/app/src/` and `/app/data/`, both mapped to your local folders.

---

## ðŸ§ª Workflow

### Read data

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_parquet("data/my_dataset.parquet")
```

### Explore & plot

```python
import plotly.express as px
fig = px.histogram(df, x="some_column")
fig.show()
```

### Write results

```python
df.to_csv("src/cleaned_output.csv", index=False)
fig.write_html("src/my_plot.html")
```

## âš¡ Features

- âœ… JupyterLab with persistent `src/` and `data/` folders
- âœ… Plotting with `plotly`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`
- âœ… Fast queries on big files with `duckdb`
- âœ… Fully reproducible + isolated Python environment

---

## ðŸ“¦ Preinstalled Python Libraries

- `pandas`
- `pyarrow`
- `duckdb`
- `plotly`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `jupyterlab`

---

## ðŸ”š To stop

```bash
docker compose down
```

---

## ðŸ’¡ Use Cases

- Ad hoc data exploration
- Notebook-based ETL prototyping
- Querying large `.parquet` files without loading everything into memory
- A sandbox to test Python data code without cluttering your main environment

---

## ðŸ§¼ Clean rebuild (if needed)

```bash
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up
```
